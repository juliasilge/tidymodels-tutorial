# Learn tidymodels ðŸ¤©

These are the materials for a one-day workshop on [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/). This workshop provides an introduction to machine learning with R using the tidymodels framework, a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) principles. We will build, evaluate, compare, and tune predictive models. Along the way, we'll learn about key concepts in machine learning including overfitting, resampling, and feature engineering. Learners will gain knowledge about good predictive modeling practices, as well as hands-on experience using tidymodels packages like parsnip, rsample, recipes, yardstick, tune, and workflows.

For a two-day workshop that this set of tutorials is based on, check out <https://workshops.tidymodels.org>
